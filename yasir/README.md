# Chapter 1
- <b>Forecasting:</b> is about predicting the future as accurately as possible, given all of the information available, including historical data and knowledge of any future events that might impact the forecasts.
- <b>Goals:</b> are what you would like to have happen. Goals should be linked to forecasts and plans, but this does not always occur. Too often, goals are set without any plan for how to achieve them, and no forecasts for whether they are realistic.
- <b>Planning:</b> is a response to forecasts and goals. Planning involves determining the appropriate actions that are required to make your forecasts match your goals.
- There are:
  - Short-term forecasts: are needed for the scheduling of personnel, production and transportation. As part of the scheduling process, forecasts of demand are often also required.
  - Medium-term forecasts: are needed to determine future resource requirements, in order to purchase raw materials, hire personnel, or buy machinery and equipment.
  - Long-term forecasts: are used in strategic planning. Such decisions must take account of market opportunities, environmental factors and internal resources.
